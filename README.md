### Research Question
What is the profile of the siesmic swarm that occured August 2020-February 2021 in the Bransfield Strait, Anarctica?

### Hypothesis
There will be a temporal pattern related to magnitude and focal mechanism. 

### Analysis

I will look at the distribution of the earthquakes and the locations of the events. I will also compared and anaylze the events by focal mechanisms. Next, I will analyze the magnitude of the earthquakes and their depths. Finally, I will conduct a temporal anaysis. 
### Dataset
